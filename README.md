Password Strength Checker and Feedback Tool
This Python tool evaluates the strength of user passwords and provides feedback. It checks for minimum length, presence of uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. Based on these criteria, it categorizes passwords as "too short," "weak," "mediumly strong," or "strong." Users can select options to either get feedback on their password or check its complexity, ensuring better security practices
